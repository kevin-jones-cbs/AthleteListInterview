## Requirements
- No errors in the console.
- The form should reset after adding an athlete.
- Clicking the Delete button should remove the athlete from the list.
- Clicking on the Edit button should update the form data, even if another athlete is already loaded in the edit form.
- You should be able to edit the name and position of an athlete.
- When adding a user, if the position is `center`, the add button should be hidden.
- There should be 2 columns, one with Add/Edit User and the other with View Users. The columns should stack on smaller devices.

## New Features
- Install a basic linter package for the project.
- Replace the hard-coded array of athletes with the athletes returned from a GET request to `https://c2c02533-38ca-4a9d-8419-aedc8dd9f0d9.mock.pstmn.io/athletes/v1`. *Note: editing/deleting don't need to be hooked up to an API.*
