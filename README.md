## Requirements
- No errors in the console.
- The form should reset after adding an athlete.
- Clicking the Delete button should remove the athlete from the list.
- Clicking on the Edit button should update the form data, even if another athlete is already loaded in the edit form.
- You should be able to edit the name and position of an athlete.
- When adding an athlete, if the position is `center`, the add button should be hidden.
- There should be 2 columns, one with the Add/Edit Athlete form and the other with View Athletes table. The columns should stack on smaller devices.

## New Features
- Install a basic linter package for the project.
- Fetch the data from the following endpoint instead of using hard-coded data. You do NOT need to implement the ability to add, edit, or delete via an API.
    - `https://04686f0d-d5ad-4e3b-85e2-d51457898a5b.mock.pstmn.io/test/athletes/`
- Memoize the functions defined in App.js.
